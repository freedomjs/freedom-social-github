# freedom-social-github

Provides implementation of the
[freedom.js social2 API](https://github.com/freedomjs/freedom-social-github/blob/master/src/social2.ts)
by using [GitHub gists](https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/) for
messaging. GitHub is authenticated via OAuth, and public key (PGP) cryptography
is used to sign/encrypt and verify/decrypt messages.
